# ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Prediction â€“ SVM Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
California suffers major losses annually due to forest fires. The goal is to predict the category of the burnt area using SVM algorithms to help local officials prepare for future fire seasons.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective
To build a predictive model that categorizes the burnt area so that preventive measures and resource planning can be made in advance.

## ðŸ”’ Business Constraints
- Variability in climatic and seasonal conditions
- Real-time predictions are not a priority but long-term planning is
- Cost-effective solution for public sector use

## ðŸ“Š Techniques Used
- SVM with Linear and Polynomial kernels
- Data Encoding and Normalization
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
The SVM model with a linear kernel provided the best performance (~90% accuracy), making it a valuable tool for forest fire preparedness planning.
