# 🏗️ Construction Firm – SVM Classification

## 📌 Problem Statement
A construction firm is planning to develop a suburban locality. To minimize the risk of loss due to unsold properties, they consulted an analytics firm to understand the area's population density and income levels. The objective is to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify and determine whether investment in that area is viable.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To assist the firm in identifying high-potential areas for property investment using predictive analytics based on population density and income level.

## 🔒 Business Constraints
- Limited access to recent demographic data.
- Model must be simple and explainable to non-technical stakeholders.
- Deployment-ready in short turnaround time.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- SVM with Linear and Polynomial kernels
- Data Preprocessing & Label Encoding
- Accuracy & Confusion Matrix Evaluation


## 📌 Conclusion
Based on the SVM analysis, the model achieved good accuracy and can be used as a decision-support tool for investment planning.
