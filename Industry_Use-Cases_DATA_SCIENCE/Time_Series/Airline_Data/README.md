## 📈 Time Series Forecasting on Airline Passenger Data
This project focuses on time series forecasting using the Airline Passengers dataset. The dataset includes monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1995 to 2002. The goal is to forecast the number of passengers for the next five years using various statistical and machine learning models.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
